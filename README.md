# JavaBasicQuestion

Hello everyone,

In this repository, I have added basic programming questions that are often asked in interviews and technical rounds. Many of you face challenges in the basics, as you may focus more on large Data Structures and Algorithms questions and forget to practice the fundamentals. I've created this repository for you, so anyone can go through it to revise their logic, clear doubts about the basics of programming.

The codes in this repository are written in the Java programming language. I will try to update this repository with solutions in different languages. Additionally, I will add more topics to the list over time so that you can revise these topics and it can also help me in my preparation for technical rounds.

Topics that have been added so far include:

Basic Programming in Java.
Pattern Problems covering various types of pattern programs.
Feel free to check out the repository [https://github.com/Prince9670/JavaBasicQuestion], contribute, and stay tuned for updates.

Best regards.
